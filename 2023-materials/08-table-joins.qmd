This week, you'll be using table joins to solve a murder mystery.

The guilty party is: your-answer-here

## Instructions
Northwestern University's Knight lab created a SQL murder mystery to help users sharpen their database skills by solving the crime that happened at SQL city. There are tables with different pieces of information - social media checkins, people, drivers licenses, crime scene reports, police interviews, and more. 

![Database schema](https://mystery.knightlab.com/schema.png)

Pick R or python, and solve the murder mystery, showing **all of your work in this document**. 

Your solution must be **reproducible** -- that is, you should use dplyr verbs, table joins, etc. to solve the mystery, rather than just looking through the tables yourselves. Your code must execute properly and stand alone.

**For 5 bonus points, when you're finished in one language, write equivalent code in the other language to solve the problem.**

When you are finished with the assignment: 

1. Save the file as 8-table-joins.qmd and compile it, making sure all of your code runs.
2. Put the name of the guilty party or parties at the top of the document.

This code chunk will read in all of the tables for you.

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
if (!"purrr" %in% installed.packages()) install.packages("purrr")
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srvanderplas/unl-stat850/master/code/06_sql-murder-setup.R")
```

This chunk ensures all tables from R are also available in python.

```{python}
crime_scene_report = r.crime_scene_report
drivers_license = r.drivers_license
facebook_event_checkin = r.facebook_event_checkin
get_fit_now_check_in = r.get_fit_now_check_in
get_fit_now_member = r.get_fit_now_member
income = r.income
interview = r.interview
person = r.person
```


To get you started, I'll set you up in the right place. 


> A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a ​murder​ that occurred sometime on ​Jan.15, 2018​ and that it took place in ​SQL City​. Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

crime_of_interest <- crime_scene_report %>%
  filter(date == "20180115", city == "SQL City", type == "murder")
crime_of_interest$description
```
