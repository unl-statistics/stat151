3.  [Scripts and Notebooks](https://srvanderplas.github.io/stat-computing-r-python/part-tools/04-scripts-notebooks.html)

# Homework1

-   Create a *Stat151* folder in a place where you can find it again

-   Go to [homework](https://srvanderplas.github.io/unl-stat151/homework/01-scripts-notebooks.html)

## Paste Everything

-   Open a quarto document in RStudio

-   Copy everything in the raw file content from last step and paste in your quarto document (make sure you paste under the source mode)
