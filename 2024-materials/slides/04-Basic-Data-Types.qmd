# We Have Done {.scrollable}

-   Homework 2: 
    -   Save files

    -   Read instructions

        -   "Copy the text after the initial command"

        -   "What is different? What is the same?"

    -   Mainly three modes: interactive, source and script

        -   Path/Where to run/How code is run/What are the outputs/Variables in environment

## Variables and Basic Data

1.  [Variables and Basic Data Types](https://srvanderplas.github.io/stat-computing-r-python/part-gen-prog/01-basic-var-types.html)

    -   Assigning variables

    -   variable types and conversion

        | R                              | Python |
        |--------------------------------|--------|
        | logical/ boolean               | bool   |
        | integer                        | int    |
        | numeric (different precisions) | float  |
        | character                      | str    |

## Functions and Libraries {.scrollable}

2.  [Using Functions and Libraries](https://srvanderplas.github.io/stat-computing-r-python/part-gen-prog/02-prog-functions.html)
    -   Mathematical operations
    -   Operation order follows mathematical rule
    -   String operation: easier in Python, little bit more work in R `paste`
    -   Functions
        -   Take arguments and mostly have return values
        -   Method - special type of function
    -   Libraries/ packages
        -   Package management:
            -   Virtual environments
            -   installing packages at the **user** or **system** level
        -   Installing packages and loading packages
        -   Pipe
            -   Heavily used in R data manipulation
            -   Not so much in Python
