# We Have Done {.scrollable}

-   Data types
-   Using functions and Using Functions and Libraries
    -   `import()` Python
    -   `library()` R
    -   `FUN(args)`

## Homework3 {.scrollable}

-   Write code and debugging

    -   import a library, call functions, data conversion, indexing

    -   Observe from visualizing, printing and reading![](fig/hw3.png){width="532"}

# We have read

[Data Structures](https://srvanderplas.github.io/stat-computing-r-python/part-gen-prog/03-data-struct.html)

Same function doesn't work equivalently on different data structures `length`

## Data Structures {.scrollable}

-   List:

    -   Different types in both R and Python

    -   Nested in R, double bracket \[\[1\]\]

-   Vector:

    -   Same data type

    -   `c()` vs `np.array`(Not just 1d), `pd.series`

-   Indexing with row,column and logical vectors

    -   Python starts at 0!

-   Matrices

    -   "gathering of vectors" - same type, 2D

    -   name the columns and row in R, not really in Python (can be done with another object in some other packages)

-   Dataframe

    -   Like a table (what you see in excel): row, columns...

    -   Commonly used functions: `head()`, `tail()`, `summary()`, `dim()`, `nrow()`... There are equivalents in pandas/numpy

        -   Many more ways to manipulate data

    -   Create a dataframe and read in data as a dataframe

# Next Time

We will get to know the essentials of programming/ creating your own function

# Homework4 {.scrollable}

-   Download and save [Homework4 raw content](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srvanderplas/unl-stat151/main/homework/04-cipher.qmd)

    -   Click the link

    -   Copy the raw content

    -   Save to a **Quarto** file under Source mode

    -   Name the file as ***04-Lastname-Firstname.qmd***

    -   Submit in .qmd file

## Homework 4 {.scrollable}

-   Follow instructions to decode a secrete message

-   Take advantage of Google/Stack overflow... if errors are raised

-   No error raised doesn't mean it's correct, print the variable to make sure it is what you are looking for

-   Checkpoints make sure you are on the right track

-   Use functions/indexing techniques to do checkpoints
