Why do we need version control?

-   Keeping track of changes

    -   code

    -   data file

    -   save as, but not exactly, we can revert too

-   Collaboration

## Git and Github {.scrollable}

    -   `commit`

    -   "make change and make a comment as a reminder in the future"

-   Github: website host git repos

    -   Hook up with git to back up your code in cloud

    -   "Google drive/ One drive"
