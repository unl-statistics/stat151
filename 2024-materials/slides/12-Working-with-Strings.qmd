## Hints and Clarifications {.scrollable}

-   Regular expressions are not necessary all the time

-   `stringr` functions are handy

-   `str_view()` vs `str_view_all()`

-   Step 3: Any time you see the word "ugh", with any number of h's, followed by a punctuation mark, delete this.

    -   ugh, ugh! ughh! ughhhh should be deleted

-   Step 4: Replace all instances of **exactly 2 a's** with exactly 2 e's.

    -   "baa" â€“\> "bee" but nothing should happen to "baaa"

-   Step 6 Every word that ends in b, change that to a y. *Hint: punctuation!*

    -   either "b!" or "b" is changed to y, no need to keep punctuation

-   By the end of step 7, you should see individual words that make sense.
