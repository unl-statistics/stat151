Anything below a 61 will receive an F.\n\nReading Quizzes\nYou will have weekly reading assignments which introduce the weekly focus area and provide different perspectives on the material. Some of these perspectives will be covered in class and used in homework assignments, but some will not be used right away. It is still important for you to read about them and file that information away for a time when it is useful.\nIn order to motivate the importance of doing the weekly reading before class, you will be given a weekly reading quiz on Canvas which covers the requisite material. These quizzes will be due before the first class of the week (so, at 1 PM on Wednesday).\nNo late quizzes will be accepted, and quizzes will lock and become inaccessible automatically at the start of class. It is to your advantage to do the reading well before class so that you do not miss out on credit for the quizzes.\n\n\nAttendance & Participation\nAll students are expected to attend and fully participate in class. Participation grades will be determined based on a combination of attendance and participation. Consistent, repeated failure to attend class or actively participate in the course will affect the participation portion of your grade.\nOne absence is allowed without any reduction in participation score - no excuse is necessary!\n\nIllness\nIf you are feeling ill, please do not come to class. Instead, review the material and work on the homework assignment, and then schedule an appointment with me to meet virtually. In the appointment reason field on Calendly, indicate that this appointment is to substitute for your in-class participation on the date you missed.\nIf you need to miss more than 1-2 classes for illness, I reserve the right to require documentation from Disability Services or a medical provider in order to continue using this substitute for attendance grades.\n\n\nInclement Weather\nIf in-person classes are canceled, you will be notified of the instructional continuity plan for this class by Canvas Announcement. In most circumstances where there is power in the Lincoln area, we will hold class via Zoom if the university cancels class. You will be held to the same participation standards on Zoom as you are in person, and participation and attendance will be graded accordingly, with some allowance for disruption at the individual level where circumstances warrant.\n\n\n\nExams\nTwo exams will be given during the course of the semester. Exams will require that you write code to solve problems utilizing the course material.\n\nExam Make-up policies\nYou are expected to take exams at the scheduled times.\nIf this is impossible due to extreme circumstances (illness, death in the family, previously scheduled activities vital to academic program), please notify me and provide appropriate documentation.\n\nNo accommodations for missed exams will be given if I am not notified at least 24h prior to the exam date.\n\nIf you miss the midterm due to extreme circumstances, I reserve the right to replace the weight of the midterm with the final exam, rather than offering you a make-up exam.\nFinal exam times are published at the beginning of the semester. The final exam for this course is scheduled at May 15, 2025 01:00 PM. I will not schedule a make-up exam unless required to by university policy (e.g. you have 3+ exams on the same day) or if there are extreme circumstances (severe illness, sudden death in the immediate family, etc.). I work extremely hard to get exams graded quickly so that everyone can get final grades; make-up exams delay this process for everyone.\n\n\n\nHomework\nApproximately 12-15 homework assignments will be made over the course of the semester. You will have one week to work on each assignment. The only way to learn statistics is to practice working problems, and homework is therefore an essential part of the course. Homework must be submitted in the file format specified, and should run or compile on my machine with no changes.\n\nLate Policy\nLate homework will be accepted only under extenuating circumstances, and only if you have contacted me prior to the assignment due date and received permission to hand the assignment in late. I reserve the right not to grade (or to assign a 0 to) any assignments received after the assignment due date.\nYou may submit an assignment that was not submitted in time as a resubmission, assuming it meets the conditions outlined in the next section.\n\n\nHomework Resubmission Policy\nLearning how to program is a process that is ongoing. I want you to not be afraid to make mistakes. As a result, I allow you to re-submit homework over the course of the semester in order to make corrections and respond to my initial feedback.\nNote: The resubmission policy does NOT apply to quizzes, exams, or projects.\nThis policy is subject to the following constraints:\n\nYou should resubmit assignments as soon as possible.\nYou may not resubmit an assignment for which solutions have been posted.\nEach assignment should be resubmitted only once.\nResubmissions are due no later than 2 weeks after the initial due date. In addition,\n\nResubmissions from weeks 1-7 must be submitted by Monday of week 8 of classes\nResubmissions from weeks 9-14 must be submitted by Monday of week 15 of classes\n\nResubmitted assignments will be graded at my convenience.\n\nI spend the extra time grading resubmissions because it reinforces your learning; this policy is not designed to improve your grade in this class.\nI reserve the right to adjust the resubmission policy over the course of the semester to ensure that it is meeting the objective of reinforcing your learning.\nI reserve the right to limit or penalize resubmissions if it becomes clear that the current policy does not promote learning of the material and/or support the course objectives.\nIn general, this policy means that I will typically not post assignment solutions, though you are welcome to visit office hours to ask questions about an assignment. ### General Grading Policies\n\n\nAssignment Evaluation Criteria\nIn every assignment, discussion, and written component of this class, you are expected to demonstrate that you are intellectually engaging with the material. I will evaluate you based on this engagement, which means that technically correct but low effort answers which do not demonstrate engagement or understanding will receive no credit.\nWhen you answer questions in this class, your goal is to show that you either understand the material or are actively engaging with it. If you did not achieve this goal, then your answer is incomplete, regardless of whether or not it is technically correct. This is not to encourage you to add unnecessary complexity to your answer - simple, elegant solutions are always preferable to unwieldy, complex solutions that accomplish the same task.\nWhile this is not an English class, grammar and spelling are important, as is your ability to communicate technical information in writing; both of these criteria will be used in addition to assignment-specific rubrics to evaluate your work.\n\n\nAssignment Oral Exams\nI reserve the right to fully or partially replace any written assignment grade with a grade based on an oral discussion of your submitted solutions. If you cannot explain how your solution works, why it is correct, and the logic behind how you got to your solution, then you will not receive credit.\nProcess:\n\nI will contact you and ask you to schedule an appointment with me to discuss .\nThis email request does NOT indicate that you are suspected of an academic integrity violation. There are many reasons I request an oral exam, and academic integrity issues are not as common as issues such as suspecting you misunderstood the question or approach.\nThis discussion may take place on zoom or in person, at my discretion.\nYou must schedule an appointment within 24 hours; the appointment time must be within 3 business days of the original email.\nThis ensures that oral exams don’t unduly delay results being returned to the whole class.\nI reserve the right to record the meeting to use in academic integrity proceedings.\n\nExplanation With the proliferation of AI tools such as Chat-GPT, as well as the old-fashioned “find solutions online and copy them without understanding how they work”, assessing your understanding of programming concepts can be difficult. This assessment is what you are paying tuition for - I need to be able to both assess your understanding and provide you with feedback about your learning progress. This is best accomplished interactively, with a back-and-forth oral discussion.\nThis policy is designed to accomplish several objectives:\n\nAllows for alternate assessment methods in cases of e.g. test anxiety\nGain additional insight into how you got to a solution and why\nExplore potential misunderstandings of question phrasing\nObtain a more nuanced understanding of your grasp of specific programming concepts\n\n\n\nAI Policy\nChat GPT can be a useful tool, but this course’s objectives are meant to assess your ability to program in R and Python, not your ability to use AI systems. Fundamentally, you need to understand concepts and develop some syntactic fluency to program effectively; generative AI solutions may hamper both of these goals if you rely on them too much.\nIt is fine to use AI to explain how some code works.\nIt is not fine to ask AI for the solution to your homework assignment.\nUltimately, if you can’t explain how you got to your solution in a logical manner, you will not receive credit.",

You may ask for help debugging this weird error, only to have someone immediately point out the problem… it is always easier to see these things in someone else’s code. This is part of programming, it is normal, and you shouldn’t feel embarrassed or apologize (unless you put no effort into troubleshooting the problem before you asked for help).\nIf you manage to produce an error I haven’t seen before, then congratulations! 👏 You have achieved something special, and that achievement should be celebrated. 🎉 Each new and bizarre error is an opportunity to learn a bit more about the programming language, the operating system, or the interaction between the two.\nProgramming is frustrating. It’s ok to take a break, walk around, or even lightly threaten your computer. The flip side is that solving those incredibly frustrating problems can be really fun. I expect you to experience both the highs and the lows of programming this semester.",

    "text": "Tasks\n\nReading in the data\nRead the CSV file using R or python. Store the resulting data in an object named gss.\n\n\nMissing Data\nSome data may be missing. Write code to create a gss_clean data frame that does not have any NAs in the year, age, or happy columns.\nThe na.omit and DataFrame.dropna() functions in R and python may be useful, but you will have to use non-default options; you can also solve this using is.na or isna in R and python plus more basic data frame manipulations.\nHint: Your data frame should have 57523 rows and 13 columns if you’ve done this correctly.\n\n\nTruncate age\nCreate a new column variable, age_dec, in your data frame. This variable must be a column in the gss_clean data frame.\n\nTake the respondent’s age and truncate it to the decade, so that 72 becomes 70 and 89 becomes 1980. A series of logical statements is one way to accomplish this, but it may be more effective to find a numerical function or combination of functions that will do a mathematical calculation instead. floor() and np.floor() in R and python respectively are good places to start.\n\n\nCreate a scatterplot (use geom_point) of age vs decade to show that your approach succeeded.\n\n\n\nVery Happy\n\nCreate a column in the gss_clean data frame, very_happy, that is TRUE (or 1) if the respondent reports being very happy.\n\n\nHow might you use this column to calculate the proportion of very happy people? Explain.\n\nReplace this line with your explanation\n\n\nHappiness of 20-somethings over time\nSuppose that we want to examine how the happiness of 20-somethings changes over time. To do this, we need to have a data set that has the following structure:\n\n\n\nyear\nvery_happy\ncount\n\n\n\n\n1972\n0.279\n369\n\n\n1973\n0.288\n347\n\n\n1974\n0.304\n349\n\n\n\n(these numbers are accurate, so you can use them to check whether you got the correct answer).\n\nHow could you get only responses from 20 year olds? Write code below to generate gss_20, a data frame containing only responses from 20 year olds, across all years of gss_clean.\n\nHint: Your data frame should have 11170 rows and 14 columns.\n\nHow could you get only responses from a single year of the gss_clean data? Write code below to generate gss_20_1972, a data frame containing only responses from 20 year olds in 1972.\n\nHint: Your data frame should have 369 rows and 14 columns.\n\nIf you had a dataset of only responses from 20-year-olds in 1972, how would you calculate very_happy? Using only a simple mathematical function, is it possible to take the work you’ve done so far and calculate this value directly?\n\n\nUse a for loop to iterate through each year, calculating the proportion of very happy 20 year olds.\n\n\nModify your for loop so that you are also calculating the total number of responses from 20 year olds in each year. Copy the code you wrote above into the code chunk here, and modify it in this code chunk (so that I can see what changed).\n\n\nModfiy your for loop so that at the end of each iteration you create a new data structure with one row for the current year, containing values year, very_happy, and count. Copy the code you wrote above into the code chunk here, and modify it in this code chunk (so that I can see what changed).\n\n\nModify your code so that each iteration of the loop appends (sticks on to) the current year’s summary data to an empty data frame created before the loop starts. You can create an empty data frame that you can add new rows to using data.frame() in R or pd.DataFrame() in python.\n\n\nUsing your summary data frame, plot the proportion of very happy 20 year olds for each year in which gss data was collected."

    "text": "Navigation\nThe following problem is inspired by the first problem in the 2021 Advent of Code challenge and as a result is Santa-themed.\nYou’re minding your own business on a ship at sea when the overboard alarm goes off! You rush to see if you can help. Apparently, one of the Elves tripped and accidentally sent the sleigh keys flying into the ocean! Before you know it, you’re inside a submarine the Elves keep ready for situations like this.\nAs the submarine drops below the surface of the ocean, it automatically performs a sonar sweep of the nearby sea floor. On a small screen, the sonar sweep report (your puzzle input) appears: each line is a measurement of the sea floor depth as the sweep looks further and further away from the submarine.\nFor example, suppose you had the following report:\n199\n200\n208\n210\n200\n207\n240\n269\n260\n263\nThis report indicates that, scanning outward from the submarine, the sonar sweep found depths of 199, 200, 208, 210, and so on.\nThe first order of business is to figure out how quickly the depth increases, just so you know what you’re dealing with - you never know if the keys will get carried into deeper water by an ocean current or a fish or something.\nTo do this, count the number of times a depth measurement increases from the previous measurement. (There is no measurement before the first measurement.) In the example above, the changes are as follows:\n199 (N/A - no previous measurement)\n200 (increased)\n208 (increased)\n210 (increased)\n200 (decreased)\n207 (increased)\n240 (increased)\n269 (increased)\n260 (decreased)\n263 (increased)\nIn this example, there are 7 measurements that are larger than the previous measurement.\nHow many measurements are larger than the previous measurement?\n\nPart 1 - Planning the solution\nDraw a program flow map to show how you plan to solve the problem. I used excalidraw.com to draw the maps in the book.\nExport your map to a png, upload it to an image hosting site like imgur, and include the link here. Make sure to link directly to the PNG (right click, get link to image).\n\n\n\nPart 2 - Writing the code\nYou have two files, hw5data-r.txt and hw5data-py.txt. I have provided you with code to read the data in from these files (if they aren’t in your current working directory, run the chunk in the Set-up section, which creates the files). Edit the code below the comment in the following chunks, storing your answer in the nx and nx2 variables. Do NOT edit the text below the code chunk – it demonstrates how you can use values from a code chunk in normal text in your document. This is a very useful tool when writing reports and larger projects, as you can make your text depend on the data, producing customized documents that have the same structure for different data sets.\nPlease do NOT print your entire vector of sonar measurements out – this takes a LOT to scroll through, and will make me very grumpy when I grade your assignment.\n\nR\n\nx &lt;- readLines(\"hw5data-r.txt\")\n\n## Solve the problem below this comment\n\n\nnx &lt;- NA # Your answer should be stored in the nx variable to make the line below this chunk work\n\nThere are NA measurements larger than the previous measurement.\n\n\nPython\n\nimport numpy as np\nx = np.loadtxt('hw5data-py.txt')\n\n## Solve the problem below this comment\n\n\nnx2 = 0 # your answer should be stored in the nx variable to make the line below this chunk work\n\nThere are 0 measurements larger than the previous measurement."

With Git you can track the changes you make to your project so you always have a record of what you’ve worked on and can easily revert back to an older version if need be. It also makes working with others easier—groups of people can work together on the same project and merge their changes into one final source!\nGitHub is a way to use the same power of Git all online with an easy-to-use interface. It’s used across the software world and beyond to collaborate and maintain the history of projects.\nGitHub is home to some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you’re visualizing data or building a new game, there’s a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics of GitHub, but we’ll dig into the rest later."

    "section": "Understanding the GitHub flow",
    "text": "Understanding the GitHub flow\nThe GitHub flow is a lightweight workflow that allows you to experiment and collaborate on your projects easily, without the risk of losing your previous work.\n\nRepositories\nA repository is where your project work happens–think of it as your project folder. It contains all of your project’s files and revision history. You can work within a repository alone or invite others to collaborate with you on those files.\n\n\nCloning\nWhen a repository is created with GitHub, it’s stored remotely in the ☁️. You can clone a repository to create a local copy on your computer and then use Git to sync the two. This makes it easier to fix issues, add or remove files, and push larger commits. You can also use the editing tool of your choice as opposed to the GitHub UI. Cloning a repository also pulls down all the repository data that GitHub has at that point in time, including all versions of every file and folder for the project! This can be helpful if you experiment with your project and then realize you liked a previous version more. To learn more about cloning, read “Cloning a Repository”.\n\n\nCommitting and pushing\nCommitting and pushing are how you can add the changes you made on your local machine to the remote repository in GitHub. That way your instructor and/or teammates can see your latest work when you’re ready to share it. You can make a commit when you have made changes to your project that you want to “checkpoint.” You can also add a helpful commit message to remind yourself or your teammates what work you did (e.g. “Added a README with information about our project”).\nOnce you have a commit or multiple commits that you’re ready to add to your repository, you can use the push command to add those changes to your remote repository. Committing and pushing may feel new at first, but we promise you’ll get used to it 🙂"

    "section": "💻 GitHub terms to know",
    "text": "💻 GitHub terms to know\n\nRepositories\nWe mentioned repositories already, they are where your project work happens, but let’s talk a bit more about the details of them! As you work more on GitHub you will have many repositories which may feel confusing at first. Fortunately, your “GitHub dashboard” helps to easily navigate to your repositories and see useful information about them. Make sure you’re logged in to see it!\nRepositories also contain READMEs. You can add a README file to your repository to tell other people why your project is useful, what they can do with your project, and how they can use it. We are using this README to communicate how to learn Git and GitHub with you. 😄 To learn more about repositories read “Creating, Cloning, and Archiving Repositories and “About README’s”.\n\n\nBranches\nYou can use branches on GitHub to isolate work that you do not want merged into your final project just yet. Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository. Typically, you might create a new branch from the default branch of your repository—main. This makes a new working copy of your repository for you to experiment with. Once your new changes have been reviewed by a teammate, or you are satisfied with them, you can merge your changes into the default branch of your repository. To learn more about branching, read “About Branches”.\nNote: In this class, you will not be required to use branches.\n\n\nForks\nA fork is another way to copy a repository, but is usually used when you want to contribute to someone else’s project. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project and is very popular when contributing to open source software projects! To learn more about forking, read “Fork a repo”\nNote: In this class, you will not be required to use forks.\n\n\nPull requests\nWhen working with branches, you can use a pull request to tell others about the changes you want to make and ask for their feedback. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add more changes if need be. You can add specific people as reviewers of your pull request which shows you want their feedback on your changes! Once a pull request is ready-to-go, it can be merged into your main branch. To learn more about pull requests, read “About Pull Requests”.\nNote: In this course, you will not be required to use pull requests.\n\n\nIssues\nIssues are a way to track enhancements, tasks, or bugs for your work on GitHub. Issues are a great way to keep track of all the tasks you want to work on for your project and let others know what you plan to work on. You can also use issues to tell a favorite open source project about a bug you found or a feature you think would be great to add!\nFor larger projects, you can keep track of many issues on a project board. GitHub Projects help you organize and prioritize your work and you can read more about them in this “About Project boards document. You likely won’t need a project board for your assignments, but once you move on to even bigger projects, they’re a great way to organize your team’s work! You can also link together pull requests and issues to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue when someone merges the pull request. To learn more about issues and linking them to your pull requests, read “About Issues”.\n\n\nYour user profile\nYour profile page tells people the story of your work through the repositories you’re interested in, the contributions you’ve made, and the conversations you’ve had. You can also give the world a unique view into who you are with your profile README. You can use your profile to let future employers know all about you! To learn more about your user profile and adding and updating your profile README, read “Managing Your Profile README”.\n\n\nUsing markdown on GitHub\nYou might have noticed already, but you can add some fun styling to your issues, pull requests, and files. “Markdown” is an easy way to style your issues, pull requests, and files with some simple syntax. This can be helpful to organize your information and make it easier for others to read. You can also drop in gifs and images to help convey your point! To learn more about using GitHub’s flavor of markdown, read “Basic Writing and Formatting Syntax”.\n\n\nEngaging with the GitHub community\nThe GitHub community is vast. There are many types of people who use GitHub in their day to day—students like you, professional developers, hobbyists working on open source projects, and explorers who are just jumping into the world of software development on their own. There are many ways you can interact with the larger GitHub community, but here are three places where you can start.\n\nStarring repositories\nIf you find a repository interesting or you want to keep track of it, star it! When you star a repository it’s also used as a signal to surface better recommendations on github.com/explore. If you’d like to get back to your starred repositories you can do so via your user profile. To learn more about starring repositories, read “Saving Repositories with Stars”.\n\n\nFollowing users\nYou can follow people on GitHub to receive notifications about their activity and discover projects in their communities. When you follow a user, their public GitHub activity will show up on your dashboard so you can see all the cool things they are working on. To learn more about following users, read “Following People”.\n\n\nBrowsing GitHub Explore\nGitHub Explore is a great place to do just that … explore :smile: You can find new projects, events, and developers to interact with.\nYou can check out the GitHub Explore website at github.com/explore. The more you intereact with GitHub the more tailored your Explore view will be."

You can use a series of logical statements if you want, but it may be more effective to find a numerical function or combination of functions that will perform the operation you want.\nfloor() and math.floor() in R and python respectively are good places to start.\nCreate a scatterplot (use geom_point) of your happy year vs decade to show that your approach succeeded.\n\n\n\nCreate a new data set by iterating through each year to find the proportion of people who are very happy. Use a for loop. Using your new data frame, plot the proportion of very happy people over time.\nNote: You may have to pass an argument to the mean function to tell it to exclude missing values from the calculation, such as na.rm or skipna. Or, you can remove the NAs from happy using a function like na.omit or dropna, but be careful to only drop rows with an NA in variables we care about, like happy or year."

    "text": "Can I use AI in this course?\nWell, I really can’t stop you.\nAI is pretty cool, if you’re using it as a personal tutor and asking it to explain why ___ happens or what ___ code does.\nIf you’re using it to do your homework, though, you’re cheating yourself out of the main thing I can provide you in this class: specific guidance as to how to learn new programming skills efficiently and effectively. Using AI to complete assignments is like using the washer spin cycle to meet your step goal for the day – you might get the illusion of success, but eventually it will catch up to you.\nI’m pretty good at detecting AI use and at knowing what a standard response to the homework questions should be. I’ve also added in-person exams to this course. And even if those measures weren’t enough, I have a syllabus policy that allows me to replace any grade with an oral exam on your submission. If you can’t tell me exactly why you did what you did, and what each function does, then … you’re not going to get credit for your answer.\nI’m not completely anti-AI - it may have a place in accelerating programming in certain contexts. But the goal of this course is to help you build the foundation to program with data, and using AI to do that is only going to make later classes much, much harder.",
