## Compile your file first

Check your compiled file before you submit to make sure it looks the way you want it.

If you want to be really sure it works, copy your qmd file to a different folder and compile that... for now, that's the best way to check that it will work on my machine.

## Images
Image links must be to the *image url*, not to the imgur *page url*

![caption text goes here](https://i.imgur.com/PKushbR.png){width=50%}

Code for this image:
```
![caption text goes here](https://i.imgur.com/PKushbR.png){width=50%}
```

You can get this url by right-clicking on the image on the Imgur page and then selecting "Copy image address":

![](images/image-387739091.png){width="25%"}

Other things that don't work:

- Including (local) file paths directly (user names changed to protect the innocent):
    - `\C:\Users\person\Documents\Flow chart HW5.png`
    - `C:\Users\person\Downloads\Stat 151\Excalidraw.png`
- Including (local) file paths in correct image syntax    
Explanation: this works on your machine, but won't work on mine because I don't have your file on my machine. You could zip the PNG file and the qmd file up together and submit that, I guess, but it's easier to follow the directions about imgur (in my opinion).

## YAML metadata
YAML metadata is the stuff between `---` at the top of your document.

- You should have only one set of metadata in your document.

In this example, you should delete the first set of YAML metadata and only include the second set that has the proper information for the assignment.

- YAML metadata indentation matters

This works:

````
output: 
  html_document:
    self_contained: yes
````

This doesn't:

````
output: html_document
  self_contained: yes
````

## Quarto default template

It's totally fine to delete the default quarto information that looks like this from the bottom/top of your file.

It's also totally fine to delete the YAML metadata that comes with that quarto default template. I usually say "Create blank document" or switch to source mode and Ctrl-A (select all) before Ctrl-V (paste) to remove everything that RStudio gives you by default.

````

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{{r}}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{{r}}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
````

## Print only necessary output

I would prefer if you didn't print out the values of a vector in the code chunks when you submit your file. Comment those out - it's useful to have them for debugging, but you don't need them for presentation purposes.

```{r, echo = F}
set.seed(24038243)
# Generate a vector of data for the problem
x <- round(runif(100, 0, 1e6))
```

What to do:
```{r}
x <- as.numeric(x)
# x # Commented out, so you can uncomment to debug if necessary
```


What not to do:
```{r}
x <- as.numeric(x)
x
```
