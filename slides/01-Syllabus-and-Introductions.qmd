## Class Schedule

```{r echo = F, message = F, warning = F}
source("../schedule.R")
class_cal
```

## Outline {.scrollable .smaller}

Subject to change based on how much programming you are already familiar with...

```{r, echo = F}
class_days %>% select(date, topic, time) %>%
  mutate(time = ifelse(is.na(time), "", time)) %>%
  mutate(date2 = format(date, "%b %e")) %>%
  magrittr::set_names(c("date", "Topic", "Time", "Date")) %>%
  select(Date, Topic) %>%
kableExtra::kable(caption = "Tentative schedule of class topics", format = "simple")
```

## Academic Integrity / Submitted Work Policy

- You may (and should!) work with each other on homework assignments

- You must be able to explain anything you submit    
[At my discretion, I can use a one-on-one discussion of your work to replace the grade for that work.]{.smaller}

- ChatGPT, StackOverflow, Google are tools, but they do not help you think
