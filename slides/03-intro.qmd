## Scripts

Homework 2 will ask you to download and run a script in Python.

    ![Right click -\> Save Page As... -\> `madlibs.py` ](images/clipboard-2196485650.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of the madlibs.py file linked in Homework 2, with the instructions on how to save the file: Right click, save page as, and give the file the name `madlibs.py`."}


## Scripts

- Navigate using the terminal so that you are in the same working directory as `madlibs.py`

  - You can get the file path in Windows by navigating in the file browser to the file, and  Shift-Right click -> Copy as path
  
  - Mac should allow you to open a terminal in a folder with shift-click (I think)
  
## Scripts in RStudio

- Then, open the script in RStudio

- Can you run it in RStudio somehow?
